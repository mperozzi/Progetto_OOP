**json-io** consists of two main classes, a reader (`JsonReader`) and a writer (`JsonWriter`).  **json-io** eliminates 
the need for using `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` to serialize Java and instead uses the JSON format.

**json-io** does not require that Java classes implement `Serializable` or `Externalizable` to be serialized, 
unlike the JDK's `ObjectInputStream` / `ObjectOutputStream`.  It will serialize any Java object graph into JSON and retain 
complete graph semantics / shape and object types.  This includes supporting private fields, private inner classes 
(static or non-static), of any depth.  It also includes handling cyclic references.  Objects do not need to have 
public constructors to be serialized.  The output JSON will not include `transient` fields, identical to the 
ObjectOutputStream behavior.

**json-io** does not depend on any 3rd party libraries, has extensive support for Java Generics, and allows extensive customization. 

### A few advantages of json-io over Google's gson library:
* gson will fail with infinite recursion (`StackOverflowError`) when there is a cycle in the input data.  [Illustrated here.](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io/blob/master/src/test/java/com/cedarsoftware/util/io/TestGsonNotHandleCycleButJsonIoCan.java) 
* gson cannot handle non-static inner classes. [Illustrated here.](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io/blob/master/src/test/java/com/cedarsoftware/util/io/TestGsonNotHandleStaticInnerButJsonIoCan.java)
* gson cannot handle hetereogeneous `Collections`, `Object[]`, or `Maps`.  [Illustrated here.](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io/blob/master/src/test/java/com/cedarsoftware/util/io/TestGsonNotHandleHeteroCollections.java)
* gson cannot handle Maps with keys that are not Strings. [Illustrated here.](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io/blob/master/src/test/java/com/cedarsoftware/util/io/TestGsonNotHandleMapWithNonStringKeysButJsonIoCan.java)

### Format
**json-io** uses proper JSON format.  As little type information is included in the JSON format to keep it compact as 
possible.  When an object's class can be inferred from a field type or array type, the object's type information is 
left out of the stream.  For example, a `String[]` looks like `["abc", "xyz"]`.

When an object's type must be emitted, it is emitted as a meta-object field `"@type":"package.class"` in the object.  
When read, this tells the JsonReader what class to instantiate.  (`@type` output can be turned off - see [User Guide](/user-guide.md)).

If an object is referenced more than once, or references an object that has not yet been defined, (say A points to B, 
and B points to C, and C points to A), it emits a `"@ref":n` where 'n' is the object's integer identity (with a 
corresponding meta entry `"@id":n` defined on the referenced object).  Only referenced objects have IDs in the JSON 
output, reducing the JSON String length.

### Performance
**json-io** was written with performance in mind.  In most cases **json-io** is faster than the JDK's
 `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream`.  As the tests run, a log is written of the time it takes to 
 serialize / deserialize and compares it to `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` (if the static 
 variable `_debug` is `true` in `TestUtil`).
 
### [User Guide](/user-guide.md)

### Pretty-Printing JSON
Use `JsonWriter.formatJson()` API to format a passed in JSON string to a nice, human readable format.  Also, when writing
JSON data, use the `JsonWriter.objectToJson(o, args)` API, where args is a `Map` with a key of `JsonWriter.PRETTY_PRINT`
and a value of 'true' (`boolean` or `String`).  When run this way, the JSON written by the `JsonWriter` will be formatted
in a nice, human readable format.

### RESTful support
**json-io** can be used as the fundamental data transfer method between a Javascript / JQuery / Ajax client and a web server
in a RESTful fashion.

See [json-command-servlet](https://github.com/jdereg/json-command-servlet) for a light-weight servlet that processes REST requests.
